FoodCorner home delivers vegetarian and non-vegetarian combos to its customer based on order.

A vegetarian combo costs Rs.120 per plate and a non-vegetarian combo costs Rs.150 per plate. Their non-veg combo is really famous that they get more orders for their non-vegetarian combo than the vegetarian combo.

Apart from the cost per plate of food, customers are also charged for home delivery based on the distance in kms from the restaurant to the delivery point. The delivery charges are as mentioned below:

Distance in kms	Delivery charge in Rs per km
For first 3kms	0
For next 3kms	3
For the remaining	6
