The account number should be of 4 digits and its first digit should be 1.
The customer should have a minimum balance of Rupees 1 Lakh in the account.
If the above rules are valid, determine the eligible loan amount and the EMI that the bank can provide to its customers based on their salary and the loan type they expect to avail.
The bank would provide the loan, only if the loan amount and the number of EMI’s requested by the customer is less than or equal to the loan amount and the number of EMI’s decided by the bank respectively.
